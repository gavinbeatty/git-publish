git-publish
===========
Gavin Beatty <gavinbeatty@gmail.com>

git publish: a simple shell script to ease the unnecessarily complex task of
"publishing" a branch, i.e., taking a local branch, creating a reference to it
on a remote repo, and setting up the local branch to track the remote one, all
in one go.

From the manpage:

    NAME
           git-publish - push a git branch to a remote and track it

    SYNOPSIS
           git-publish [OPTIONS] [<remote>]

    DESCRIPTION
           Publish <branch> to <remote> and configure the local <branch> to track
           <branch> on the remote end.

    OPTIONS
           -v, --verbose
               Print the git commands before executing them.

           -n, --dry-run
               Don’t run any of the git commands. Only print them, as in -v.

           -f, --force
               Don’t run any tests on the local and remote branches to see if they
               are already tracking branches, etc.

           -d, --delete
               Delete the specified <branch> from <remote> and stop tracking it.

           -b, --branch=<branch>
               The branch we wish to publish.

           -t, --tracking-only
               Don’t push any local branches or delete any remote ones - only
               change tracking configuration.

           --version
               Print version info in the format ´git publish version $version´.

           <remote>
               The remote to which you want to publish.

    EXIT STATUS
           0 on success and non-zero on failure.
